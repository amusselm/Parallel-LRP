Project Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To the requirements of Cal Poly's Computer Science department for senior
 project, I intend to implement a version of the Irregular Terrain with
 Obstructions Model (IOWTM) for graphics proscessors.
 I will then measure how much, if any, preformance gain this approach has.
 In order to make this utility easier to use, I may also attempt to develop
 a simple graphical addation to existing maping software to make it easier
 for communications technicians and broadcast engineers to use this tool.

General Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ITWOM is a mathicmatical model that attempts to perdict how radio waves
 will propigate over known terrain features.
 This is useful for

link budgeting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where communications technicians and radio operators attempt to map how
 well a radio link or broadcast will work over a given path or area.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an existing implementation of the ITOWM.
 However, this implementation for a single, general-purpose CPU.
 I believe it may be possible to achieve a significant increase in performance
 by adapting the ITOWM to run in parallel on a GPGPU.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The ITOWM and the Longely-Rice Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ITOWM is largely derrived from the older Longely-Rice Model, with a
 number of changes and corrections that its author, Sidney E.
 Shumate, claims improve its overall accuracy.
 Addationally, their changes allow the practical use of higher-resoluation
 elevation data.
 Shumate also designed his code to work as a drop-in replacement for the
 Longely-Rice Model.

 Since the two algorithims are so similar in terms of their overall structure
 and control flow, exiting research into how one is paraellized might be
 directly applicable to the other.

\begin_layout Subsection
SPLAT!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SPLAT is a command-line wrapper program for the ITOWM, Longely-Rice Model
 and other RF-Propigation algorithims.
 It takes in appropiately formated elevation data and various prarmaters
 about each of the transmitters or receivers that the user wishes to model.
 It has the option of outputting a bitmap or a KML file for Google Earth
 for graphically representating coverage information.
 It also generates text files that contain information about each radio
 site and nearby obstructions.

Project Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Primary Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary objective of the project will be to create a paraell version
 of the ITOWM to link directly into SPLAT, ideally with minimal modification
 to SPLAT itself.
 To insure that the modified application still generates valid output, I
 will compare the output of my version of the ITOWM to the stock version.
 Addationally, I will run benchmarks on the modified program to measure
 the preformance of the modified version of the ITOWM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Secondary Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project may include a number of secondary objectives, depending outcome
 of the primary objectives and the project schedule.
 These might include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implemenatating a 3d graphical frontend to SPLAT using NASA's Worldwind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implementating a 2d web-based frontend to SPLAT using OpenLayers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Modifications to SPLAT or creating a new wrapper program to make the IWOTM
 easier to work with for other mapping applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Limatations to the Project Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since I lack a technical background in RF propigation, I will not attempt
 to measure or improve the real-world accuracy of the IWOTM.
 Although both I and the author of the IWOTM
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 think that such improvements may be possible, I think that such efforts
 are beyond the scope of this project at this time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Existing Related Works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number the existing serial implementations of the Longley-Rice
 Model, including a refrence implementation maintained by the US Department
 of Commerce
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "us_commerce"

\end_inset

.
 This refrence implementation is the basis of the IWOTM
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VTC_IWOTM"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addationally, a pair of University of Arizona researchers have recently
 made implementations of the Longley-Rice Model for both for IBM's Cell
 proscessor and for Nvidia's Tesla C870 GPU
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lrp_itm_gpu"

\end_inset

.
 These reaserchers found that were able to reduce execuation times to less
 than a second.
 They also found that the Telsa GPU was around 2-3 times as fast as the
 IBM cell proscessor.
 This confirms that the Longely-Rice Model is suitable for parallel processing,
 which makes it highly likely that the IWOTM will have similar performance
 gains when it is adapted for use on the GPU.

SPLAT Benchmark results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Test Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To establish a baseline benchmark for SPLAT, I ran a set number tests on
 the existing SPLAT implementation.
 For these tests, I modified SPLAT's build script to embed debug information
 and generate runtime profiles, which may have hurt overall performance
 somewhat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These tests focused on the terrain surrounding Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.
 SPLAT does not load terrain data for ocean areas.
 Therefore, running SPLAT over a coastal area like the terrain surrounding
 Cal Poly would result in SPLAT spending less time reading terrain data
 from disk compared to inland areas.
 Additionally, all of these tests assume a receiver at 10 feet above ground.
 This may only stress part of the IOWTM, while leaving other parts of the
 code unused.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these tests were run on Tesla, a Cal Poly Computer Science department
 server.
 This computer is equipped with a pair of Intel Intel Xeon E5504 CPUs.
 The build of SPLAT used was configured to analyze the largest possible
 region, which the highest possible memory requirements.
 Additionally, I elected to use the highest-resolution elevation data that
 is available for use with SPLAT.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I created a simple shell script to run these tests.
 This script ran as a loop: for each integer between 1 and 100, the script
 told SPLAT to simulate propagation of a given frequency from 50 foot high
 antenna on the Cal Poly campus to a hypothetical receiver that was located
 10 feet off of the ground for all points within that integer miles radius
 of the transmitter.
 This would show how total runtime and the number of times specific functions
 were called were effected by the amount of data to be processed.

\begin_layout Subsection
Running Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When comparing the radius to the execuation time, I found that the execuation
 time increases polynominally with the radius of the area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

	filename chart_radius.png
	scale 80

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the amount of terrain data that SPLAT has to load and proscess
 also increases polynominally.
 Therefore, it makes sense to compare the execuation time to the total area
 over which SPLAT is calculating signal strengths.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename chart_area.png
	scale 80

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond around 10,000 square miles, the execuation seems to be growing only
 slightly faster than linearly with area.
 I suspect this gradual increase in the rate that execuation time is increasing
 by time is caused by the overhead of loading addational map tiles.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on my research and benchmark tests, I believe that the IOWTM is a
 good canidate for GPGPU computing.
 For smaller areas, the use of a GPGPU might make the calculations almost
 instantinious, which should improve the experience for end users.
 Users might also use this paraell computing capibility to create graphs
 over larger areas.
 Therefore, if I am successful, I feel that this project will have some
 real-world usefulness.
