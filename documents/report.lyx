General Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ITWOM is a mathematical model that attempts to predict how radio waves
 will propagate over a given path with known elevations.
 By repeating this process for a number of different paths over an area,
 its possible to generate a coverage map that shows the theoretical signal
 strength of a transmitter over a given area.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The ITWOM and the Longley-Rice Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ITWOM is largely derived from the older Longley-Rice Model, with a number
 of changes and corrections that its author, Sidney E.
 Shumate, claims improve its overall accuracy.
 Additionally, their changes allow the practical use of higher-resolution
 elevation data.
 Shumate also designed his code to work as a drop-in replacement for the
 Longley-Rice Model.

 Since the two algorithms are so similar in terms of their overall structure
 and control flow, exiting research into how one is parallelized might be
 directly applicable to the other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
SPLAT!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SPLAT is a command-line wrapper program for the ITWOM, Longley-Rice Model
 and other RF-Propagation algorithms.
 It takes in appropriately formatted elevation data and various parameters
 about each of the transmitters or receivers that the user wishes to model.
 It has the option of outputting a bitmap or a KML file for Google Earth
 for graphically representation coverage information.
 It also generates text files that contain information about each radio
 site and nearby obstructions.

\begin_layout Subsection
SPLAT's Approach to Signal Loss Analysis Over an Area
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After loading the necessary terrain files, SPLAT chooses loops over all
 points on the border of a square around the transmitter site.
 For each point, it generates a path from the transmitter site to the point
 on the border of this square.
 This path consists of an array that represents the terrain heights between
 the transmitter site and the point on the border of the square, along with
 an overall length of the path and the number of points stored in the path.
 Then, for each point on all of these paths, it calls ITWOM's point to point
 path loss function for every possible point between the transmitter and
 the point on the edge of the analysis area.
 This point to point path loss function returns theoretical amount of signal
 loss along that path, which SPLAT stores in the area's data structure.
 This is described using psuedocode in Algorithm

\begin_layout Subsection
Longely Rice and ITWOM Approach to Path Loss
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both Longley Rice and the ITWOM have the same overall program structure.
 In fact, the ITWOM source file that shipped with SPLAT contained both versions
 of the Irregular Terrain Model.
 Many of the functions were shared between them, and the ones that weren't
 often shared the same parameters and purpose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both algorithms first determine if the receiver site is in line of site
 of transmitter.
 Then, they call a separate set of calculations for each.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "longley1968prediction"

\end_inset

 As a result, the calculations within the point_to_point() function cannot
 be easily parallelized.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Issues with Parallelization 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the most part, each path is independent of the others.
 The results of one point to point calculation are not needed to calculate
 others.
 However, there are some issues with the ITWOM code that might effect paralleliz
ation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Repeated Points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only data dependency is the marking of points as having already been
 analyzed.
 Due to the geometry of each path, points closest will be hit multiple times,
 so this check is still necessary to prevent duplication of effort.
 If the approach described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:path-on-device"

\end_inset

is used, it might be possible to avoid this duplication of effort by synchronizi
ng reads and writes to the global data structure.
 If one of the other approaches is used, the host code will have to throw
 some results away after reading from the device.
 This is shown by

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The qlrps() Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the Longley-Rice and ITWOM ITM algorithms use a function called qlrps()
 to initialize several parts of an internal data structure.
 This function does not take the terrain profile as an input.
 In fact, it does not take any path-specific parameters as input.
 Since all the parameters it takes as input are the same for all paths that
 SPLAT is calculating, this results in the same code being repeated multiple
 times with the same inputs, which might be considered a waste of resources.
 In fact, University of Arizona researchers who were investigating a parallel
 implementation of Longley-Rice modified the program so that this initialization
 step was only needed once 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lrp_itm_gpu"

\end_inset

.
 To simplify implementation and to minimize the effects of modifications
 that are not necessarily related to parallelization the author choose not
 to modify this function beyond what was necessary run it in OpenCL.
 This means that the qlrps() function is called multiple times on the OpenCL
 device.

Parallelization Strategies

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Generate Paths on the Device
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:path-on-device"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One approach to parallelizing this problem is to take the task of generating
 each terrain profile and put it on the device side.
 Then, run through a loop on the device side processing each point along
 each path, putting the results back into the data structure that represents
 both signal loss and elevation at each point.
 The advantage to this approach is that the system has to transfer vastly
 less data to and from the device and it requires less device and host memory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this comes at a cost of greater complexity of the code that is
 run on the device.
 Implementation is much more difficult than some of the other approaches
 because there is that much more code that has to be adapted to run in OpenCL
 and synchronization of work items that are accessing the same data structure
 becomes more of an issue.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author initially attempted to implement this approach before encountering
 difficulties, and switching to the multidimensional work-items approach
 described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Multidimensional-Work-Items"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Path at a Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another approach is to simply push one path at a time to the device and
 run the path loss calculations in parallel for each point along that path.
 This approach has the advantage of having the lowest memory requirements
 of all of these proposed methods.
 This comes at a cost of having to transfer much more data to and from the
 device over the course of plotting the path loss over an area.
 For points that are close to the transmitter, the distance between two
 paths is minimal, which means the same altitude data is sent to device
 code multiple times with this approach.
 There is also the additional cost in having to enqueue each item separately.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Block at a Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's possible to reduce the overhead of the path-at-a-time approach by creating
 a buffer that contains a certain number of paths and another buffer that
 is used to store the path loss results from each point.
 In exchange, both the host system and the device must have the memory to
 support this buffer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Multiple Paths/Blocks at a Time With Callbacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenCL also provides a callback functionality that allows host system code
 to be called when a work item completes.
 With the right host system code, this could be used load more data onto
 the device while other elements are calculating.
 One could even go so far as to have calculations running while more data
 is being loaded from disk, so that the system can do path loss calculations
 while also doing IO.
 However, the author believes that this would effectively require a complete
 re-write of SPLAT, which doesn't currently support any sort of dynamic
 loading of terrain data at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Multidimensional Work Items
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Multidimensional-Work-Items"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenCL also provides functionality to deal with multidimensional work items.
 This means that the host system can pass arguments to the device in the
 form of a multi-dimensional array.
 This eliminates the need to loop over elements in a path on the device,
 which makes the task more parallel.
 However, this approach still requires sending each path to the device individua
lly, which means that more data must be sent to the device than if the paths
 were generated on the device itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Implementation and Modifications to SPLAT and the ITM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author initially attempted to implement the ITM in parallel by generating
 all paths on the device, as decried in section
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:path-on-device"

\end_inset

.
 However this implementation did not work.
 The author attributes the failure of this method to a combination the potential
 compiler bug mentioned in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:IntelCLBUg"

\end_inset

 and the difficulty of passing the complex data structure that contains
 elevation data from the host to the device.
 Because the host and device have completely separate memory spaces, pointers
 that are valid in the host process will not be valid in any of the device's
 memory spaces unless they have been explicitly set as a kernel argument.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author switched to the multidimensional work-item approach described
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Multidimensional-Work-Items"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order translate the ITWOM code to OpenCL and run it in parallel, a number
 of changes had to be made to both the ITWOM code and SPLAT.
 Some of these changes, such as removing the instances of static that appear
 in the ITWOM code are necessary due to limitations of the OpenCL programming
 language.
 Parts of SPLAT required some refactoring due to SPLAT's prodigious abuse
 of global variables and to create the necessary buffers for OpenCL to read
 data from and write data to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the author had to add code that compiled the OpenCL code and
 set up the devices that would run this code.
 These steps would add some overhead to the process, which is an unavoidable
 cost of using OpenCL for parallelization.
 This might put OpenCL at a disadvantage to other parallelization techniques
 on some systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, due to some of the limitations of OpenCL, a number of features
 had to be removed from SPLAT in order to make it work using OpenCL.
 Because OpenCL lacks a direct file input and output functionality the author
 decided to remove a feature that allowed storing of signal loss results
 in a log file in addition to being displayed in the final output.
 Had SPLAT handled the output of the contents of this log file differently,
 this measure would not have been necessary.
 Additionally, the author removed a feature that computes loss based vertical
 radiation pattern of an antenna to avoid triggering a potential Intel OpenCL
 compiler bug.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Test Procedure
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Test-Procedure-stock"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To establish a baseline benchmark for SPLAT, the author ran a set number
 tests on the existing SPLAT implementation.
 For these tests, the author modified SPLAT's build script to embed debug
 information and generate runtime profiles, which may have hurt overall
 performance somewhat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These tests focused on the terrain surrounding Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.
 SPLAT does not load terrain data for ocean areas.
 Therefore, running SPLAT over a coastal area like the terrain surrounding
 Cal Poly would result in SPLAT spending less time reading terrain data
 from disk compared to inland areas.
 Additionally, all of these tests assume a receiver at 10 feet above ground.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these tests were run on Tesla, a Cal Poly Computer Science department
 server.
 This computer is equipped with a pair of Intel Xeon E5504 CPUs, each of
 which have 4 CPU cores.
 The build of SPLAT used was configured to analyze the largest possible
 region, which the highest possible memory requirements.
 Additionally, the author elected to use the highest-resolution elevation
 data that is available for use with SPLAT.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author created a simple shell script to run these tests.
 This script ran as a loop: for each integer between 1 and 100, the script
 told SPLAT to simulate propagation of a given frequency from 50 foot high
 antenna on the Cal Poly campus to a hypothetical receiver that was located
 10 feet off of the ground for all points within that integer miles radius
 of the transmitter.
 This would show how total runtime and the number of times specific functions
 were called were effected by the amount of data to be processed.
 This shell script is shown in Algorithm

 execution time increases polynomially with the radius of the area.

However, the amount of terrain data that SPLAT has to load and process also
 increases polynomially.
 Therefore, it makes sense to compare the execution time to the total area
 over which SPLAT is calculating signal strengths.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond around 10,000 square miles, the execution seems to be growing only
 slightly faster than linearly with area.
 The author suspects this gradual increase in the rate that execution time
 is increasing by time is caused by the overhead of loading additional map
 tiles and stitching the results of the ITWOM into a completed graph.
 This would mean that the ITWOM has an experimental O(n), where n is the
 number of points to be analyzed.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Running Makeup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all but the smallest areas, the vast majority of SPLAT's computing time
 is spent running the ITWOM calculations.
 Generally, as the radius of analysis increases, so does the proportion
 of time that SPLAT spends on the ITWOM calculations.
 However, there are some points where the proportion of time SPLAT spends
 on the ITWOM calculations briefly decreases.
 This pattern is shown in figure

Performance Changes with Parallelization 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Maximum Theoretical Performance Gain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the signal loss is at each point is calculated independently of the
 others, we might be able to estimate the maximum theoretical performance
 gain by simply dividing the time spent on the ITWOM operations by the number
 of equivalent compute cores available.
 This approach is unrealistically optimistic in that it ignores any overhead
 associated with compiling the OpenCL code, copying data to and from each
 device, and copying output data into SPLAT's global data structures.
 Nor does it account for any performance loss due to changes that may be
 necessary due to device or host memory limitations or the increased use
 of memory on the host.
 This approach is only valid when comparing single-thread performance to
 a number of equivalent processor cores.
 For example, the differing performance characteristics of a CPU and a GPU
 might make this approach invalid for estimating the maximum performance
 of SPLAT if its ITWOM operations were to be run on a GPU.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the data gathered by the benchmark described in section
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Test-Procedure-stock"

\end_inset

, if all 8 CPU cores on Tesla could be used for the ITWOM calculations,
 the time it takes to plot path losses over an an area with a radius of
 100 miles could be decreased form over 12,500 seconds to roughly 2100 seconds.
 This is a 83% improvement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further incremental performance improvements might be possible by adding
 additional cores.
 If there are 14400 cores, that is, one for every path that is generated
 from the terrain data, than the time it takes complete this task drops
 to around 590 seconds, for a 95% improvement versus the stock time or a
 28% improvement over the 8 core version.
 However, clustering and networking would be required to to allocate 14400
 CPU Cores to the task.
 This overhead would likely eat into any further performance gains.

SPLAT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the process of adapting SPLAT to use OpenCL, the author found SPLAT to
 be difficult to use and almost unmaintainable.
 With the exception of the ITWOM and Longley-Rice code, all of SPLAT's functiona
lity is contained in a single file.
 SPLAT uses global variables extensively, making it difficult to re-factor
 or re-use SPLAT's code.

Potential Intel OpenCL Bugs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "implementation"

\end_inset

, the author believes that he might have found a bug in the OpenCL Compiler.
 In the device-side code there is a function called PlotLRPath(), which
 is described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "alg:PlotLRPath-reduced"

\end_inset

.
 The mere presence of certain lines within that function causes any kernel
 that is defined in the same file to fail, regardless if that kernel calls
 the suspect function or not.
 As stated in section
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "implementation"

\end_inset

, the author was able to avoid the issue by simply removing the suspect
 line and all other calculations necessary to account for the antenna's
 vertical radiation pattern.

\begin_layout Standard
The author also found and was able to find and actually isolate a separate
 and possibly unrelated bug in the Intel OpenCL compiler.
 In this case, passing a variable that is a struct that contains a two dimension
al array to a function causes the causes the Intel OpenCL compiler to fail
 silently, resulting in a device-side program that fails to run at all.
 This failure happens even if the code that contains the two dimensional
 array isn't called by the kernel that is run.
 The mere presence of a function call that includes a struct that contains
 a two dimensional array is sufficient.
 The author found that the issue did not exist with AMD's Open CL compiler
 and libraries.

\begin_layout Subsection
Implementing a Better Wrapper for ITWOM and Longely Rice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously noted, SPLAT has a number of issues that make it a very difficult
 piece of software to maintain and work with.
 It should be straightforward to create a vastly improved set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrapper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 code that handles the loading of the terrain data and other propagation
 information and calling the existing ITWOM or Longely Rice Code.
 Such a program might have the following new features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Support for external elevation databases.
 The USGS, Google and others maintain web services that provides elevation
 data from its database for a user given area.
 This would save the user from having to maintain a local elevation database.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Support for other GIS information for clutter and other properties.
 Currently, SPLAT assumes a uniform amount of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clutter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 above the ground throughout the mapped area.
 With data sources like the Openstreetmap project and other geographical
 databases, it should be possible to estimate the real height of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clutter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on a path-by-path basis.
 This might improve the accuracy of propagation estimates in an area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Support for dynamically loading terrain and elevation data.
 SPLAT currently loads ALL elevation data before running a single propagation
 calculation.
 Since each path is independent with Longely Rice, terrain can be loaded
 dynamically and discarded when no longer needed.
 This could reduce the program's memory footprint over large areas and it
 might even improve performance by allowing propagation calculations to
 occure while other pieces of terrain are being loaded.
